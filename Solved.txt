    Solution: All you have to do is open the .exe file in any common text editor, in it you will see the password in normal words because all the string/char types in this binary file have not been converted to binary. The rest will be strange symbols or unordered words.
    Solution 2: If you are a Linux User then you can use Linux 'String' command to see the text inside a binary file. 
    The Linux strings command pulls those bits of text—called “strings”—out for you. (Example: strings test)
